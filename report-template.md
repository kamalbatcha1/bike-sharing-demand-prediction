# Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
#### NAME HERE
H.Kamal Batcha
## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
TODO: Add your explanation
Initial model We are predicting count, so set the label as count and I am not adding any features and before submitting the model all negative value set to 0 because Kaggle will reject the submission if we don't set everything to be > 0 and I got a score of 1.79818

### What was the top ranked model that performed?
TODO: Add your explanation
After hyperparameter tuning the hpo model got 0.46423

## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
TODO: Add your explanation
In the first model I got 1.79818 and I separate out the datetime into hour, day, month, year after adding these feature and season,weather dtype as category and I trained again and I got 0.64953 
### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
TODO: Add your explanation
after adding features my model got tremendous score that is 1.79818 to 0.64953 
## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
TODO: Add your explanation
after adding the features and next is hyperparameter optimization so first i used rf model having 'n_estimators': [100,125,150] ,'max_depth': [5, 7,10],'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4],'max_features': ['auto', 'sqrt', 'log2'] and gbm having  'num_boost_round':85, 'max_depth':5 and hyperparameter_tune_kwargs having num_trails:2 and after fine tuning I got a score of 0.46423 

### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
TODO: Add your explanation
I spend more time in hyperparameter optimization I tune this model using several hyperparameter to find out which is better 
### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.
|model|hpo1|hpo2|hpo3|score|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|initial|'default_vals'|'default_vals'|'default_vals'|1.79818|
|add_features|'default_vals'|'default_vals'|'default_vals'|0.64953|
|hpo|'n_estimators: 100,125,150'|'max_depth:5, 7, 10'|'num_boost_round:85'|0.46423|

### Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.

## Summary
TODO: Add your explanation
In the initial model I got a score of 1.79818 after seperate out datetime feature into year,month,day, hour and season & weather as dtype category after adding these feature and I got a score 0.64953 and after hyper parameter tuning the model is far better score of 0.46423
